# Resolve Core

Whenever I've played an RPG, I've felt like the rules never really gave me the flexibility and ease of play that I wanted. Many rulesets have aspects that I like but none really hit the spot. This is my attempt at adapting the things I've learned into a cohesive framework that I and others can build upon easily to have fun quickly with common language and straightforward rules. Hopefully you'll find something you like here that will inspire you.

## Design Principles

- Exciting moments often come from just scraping by or lucky rolls.
- Failure should have choices.
- When the end is coming, players should be able to see it in the distance.
- Players should have choices on how to ride a death spiral.
- Rolling high feels really good.
- Rolling a handful of dice feels really good.
- Waiting for everyone at the table to roll to attempt something isn't fun.
- The mechanics should provide a consequences with varying levels of permenance.
- GMs have enough things to do with recordkeeping and storytelling, so use worksheets.
- GMs generally need a simple, clear toolbox and not railroads or finished products.

Rules here are inspired by aspects of Blades in the Dark, Slugblaster, Cypher, and Legend in the Mist.

## Core

### Attributes

* 1 Profession
* 1 Background
* 4 Skills
* 6 Resolve
* 2 Wounds
* 4 pieces of Gear

### Take Action

- Take Action by rolling 1d6 + 1 extra d6 for each Profession, Background, Skill, Gear, or other benefit that helps your action. Describe how, then roll. The highest die counts.
  - 6 = Success
  - 4-5 = Success + Cost
  - 1-3 = Fail

#### _Wounds_ make it harder to succeed.
- 0 Wounds = Success + Cost on 4 or 5
- 1 Wound = Success + Cost only on 5
- 2 Wounds = No Success + Cost

#### Choose a _Boost_ when you roll a pair of 6s:
- **Overwhelm**. Increase impact.
- **Recover**. Heal 1 Wound.
- **Charge**. Store 1d6 to use on any roll.
- **Windfall**. Someone thinks of a benefit.

#### _Combat_ is Taking Action with the intent to harm.
- Your opponent must take a specific number of wounds to be incapacitated. Some targets may make Gear more or less effective.

### Resolve

- **Resolve** is your determination, willpower and composure. You only have **6**. **Each adds 1d6 to your dice pool** and you can spend it **incrementally** on a roll until you succeed or you accept the rolled result. **Spent Resolve is called Doubt**. When you mark more Resolve than you have, take **1 Trauma**.

#### Resolve and Doubt Rolls
- The GM may call for a Resolve or Doubt roll, 1d6 for each you have. Highest value counts, like with Take Action. Results here are unaffected by Wounds.

### Assist

- **Assist** another character by describing how and spend one Resolve to grant them +1d6.

### Wealth

- **Wealth** lets you acquire valuables. Roll 1d6 for each rank in Wealth, add the results and compare to the item’s Value. **If you’re short, you may offer a Favor** to claim your prize. The size of the favor depends on how short you are; GM decides. GM may call on that favor at any time.

### Background

- **Background** is your personal history.

### Profession

- **Profession** is the job you’re trained in.

### Drive

- **Drive** is what motivates you.

### Problem

- **Problem** is what haunts you.

### Skills

- **Skills** are what you're particularly good at. You only have enough time to train on 4, but you can learn the same Skill multiple times. Each occupies a new slot.

### Harm

- **Harm** is the accumulation of negative things that happen to you. Harm progresses in the following way: **When you run out of Wounds, you take Doubt. When you run out of Resolve, you take Trauma.**

#### You _Recover Harm_ in the following ways:
- **Wounds** via Gear and Relief Arcs.
- **Resolve** via buying Relief Arcs with Doubt.
- **Trauma** via the end of Relief Arcs or special cases.

### Wounds

- **Wounds** are injuries. They reduce your Partial Success range by one. You may take **2 Doubt or Break Gear to Avoid a Wound.**

### Trauma

- **Trauma** is long-lasting pain. It disables a Skill slot and prevents its use. **1 slot per Trauma**. Taking a Trauma accounts for all Harm at that moment, so you only take 1 at a time. **When you gain your 4th, your character is retired** - they cannot continue.

### Gear

- **Gear** helps you solve problems and achieve goals. Larger Gear takes multiple slots. Broken Gear must be repaired to be usable. You can hold at most 4 pieces of Gear.

### Bonds

- **Bonds** represent the relationships that keep you grounded. Each Bond is ranked from 1-4. Bonds break when reaching 0. To test a Bond, roll 1d6 for each rank, highest value counts.

### Relief Arcs

- Relief Arcs represent moments of recovery, reflection, and change. You spend Doubt on them to grow and recover.


## Making a Character

* Choose your Background, Profession, Drive, and Problem
* Choose 1 Skill
* Choose enough Gear to fill 2 slots
* Set your Wealth to 1
* Choose 2 important relationships in your life, one at rank 2, the other at rank 1.
* Choose a name

## GM

### Principles

- Only you know all of the details. None of the players know if everything or nothing is planned, only that they have fun and get the information they need.
- Low- to no-prep play with improvisation _tends_ to result in more fun and emergent stories.
- Ask the players questions about the world to fill in gaps. It's not all on you to fill out the world.

### Crafting the Story

All great stories have a Setup, Conflict, Climax, and Resolution. You're not writing all the details of a story, though. You're playing an RPG with other people, and that story will be written at the table together. There are really only two points you'll need to think about at the outset. Most of everything else is, or at least can be, improvised.

- Core Conflict: What is the main problem that the players need to solve?
- Setup: How do the players get a clue that this conflict exists?

### Clairvoyance

To get players to contribute to the story, you can grant them minor Clairvoyance. Each player receives 2 Clairvoyance tokens at the start of a session and they can spend them to answer a specific question about a scene and, in return, receive a specific benefit. Use these when you're not sure what to do in a scene, want to offload some of the cognitive load, create a more collaborative world, or simply re-engage players.

Use your judgement on whether their answer adds enough to the story to be worthy of the benefit.

Here are a few options on how to handle offering players a chance to spend Clairvoyance:
1. Give players a few question options
2. Give players one question but choose their benefit
2. Allow the players to choose which question they want to answer to receive the desired benefit.

#### Questions and Benefits

X can represent a character, object, scene, or anything else in the game world.

| Question                                   | Benefit                                        |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| What does X truly desire?                  | Auto Success when you offer what they desire   |
| What does X look like?                     | You always know where to find X                |
| What does X smell like?                    | Repair 1 Broken Gear                           |
| What does X sound like?                    | +1 to next Wealth roll                         |
| What's the first thing you notice about X? | +1d6 on next social interaction with X         |
| What is a positive memory you have with X? | Heal 1 Wound                                   |
| What is a negative memory you have with X? | Next successful attack applies +1 Wound        |
| How do you know X?                         | +1 rank to any Bond                            |
| Who is X allied with?                      | +1d6 when using X's alliance as leverage       |
| Who hurt X in their past?                  | +1d6 when using X's source of pain as leverage |
| What's a rumor people tell about X?        | Next Failed roll is upgraded to Success + Cost |
| What's the weirdest thing about X?         | Avoid next Wound for free                      |

### Locations

Each location has a name, short description, and at most 4 important things there. Each is tagged with an adjective and a noun to make it easy to see what’s what. For example:

- Location: Esperanza Cove
- Description: Pink 4-plex, dated wood, smells like paella

Living things, creatures, etc. have a name, look, and persona that provide 1 or 2 word descriptions to understand the core of the character and how to represent them as a GM. The Power is the base level you’ll use for generating target numbers for challenges; it’s a way to see how influential entities are relative to each other. Details provide more color as needed. For example:

- Mundane Person
- Name: Janice
- Look: Beachbum
- Persona: Bored
- Power: 4
- Details: Praises the sun a bit too much. Reads smutty Romance novels with topless male models on them.

Gear and non-living objects obviate the need to have a look, persona, and such and simply have a proper name. They also have details that can provide more color about what the object does, how powerful it is, and any checks or conditions that must be met to get certain outcomes. For example:

- Weird Book
- Name: What's That Dead Thing?
- Details: Reference manual that helps you identify anything that's actually dead. Doubt 9 to also look up how the particular thing died.
